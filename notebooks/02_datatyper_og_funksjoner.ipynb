    "\n",
    "Python has several in-built datatypes that we can use to structure and manipulate our data. These can be broadly categorized into two types: atomic datatypes and container datatypes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Atomic Datatypes\n",
    "\n",
    "Atomic datatypes are the simplest forms of data that Python can work with. They are `immutable`, meaning their value cannot be changed once they are created. Examples of atomic datatypes include:\n",
    "\n",
    "    int (integer): This is a whole number. For example, 3, -10, 0.\n",
    "    float (floating point number): This is a decimal number. For example, 3.14, -0.1, 10.0.\n",
    "    str (string): This is a sequence of characters. For example, \"Hello\", 'World', \"123\".\n",
    "    bool (boolean): This is a binary value, either True or False.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much like we covered in the previous lecture, all these are `objects` with their own `properties` and `methods`\n",

    "### Hashed Containers vs Non-Hashed Containers\n",
    "\n",
    "One key difference between dictionaries and lists (or tuples) is how they handle lookups. Dictionaries are hashed containers, meaning they use a `hash-table` for storing items, which allows for *fast lookups*. Lists and tuples, on the other hand, are `non-hashed` containers, meaning lookups are done sequentially, which can be slower for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TLDR about hashing**: When we say that something is hashed, we mean that something is indexed and can be quickly retrieved using that index. It basically means that the computer already knows where to look and only uses one operation to find it. If something is non-hashed it is not indexed and the computer has to loop through it to find it, hence using many operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The longer, nerdier version:\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, hashing refers to the process of converting an object into a fixed-size string of bytes, known as a hash value or hash digest. The hash value is used as an index to quickly locate the original object in a hash table, which is a data structure used for implementing associative arrays or dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we say that an object is hashed in Python, we mean that it has a hash value that can be used to store and retrieve the object in a hash table. Objects that are hashed in Python must be immutable, because their hash value must remain constant over the lifetime of the object.\n",

    "### Optional reading on how mutability-issues come about\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, mutability stems from how Python stores and assigns names to objects in memory. When you create an object in Python, such as a list or a dictionary, Python stores that object in memory and assigns it a unique memory address.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you assign a name to an object in Python, you are creating a reference to that object in memory. For example, consider the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this code, we are creating a list object `[1, 2, 3]` and assigning it to the name `my_list`. Python stores this list object in memory and assigns it a unique memory address. The name `my_list` is then associated with this memory address, so that we can use `my_list` to refer to the list object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, suppose we create a new name that refers to the same list object:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_other_list = my_list\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this code, we are creating a new name `my_other_list` and assigning it to the same memory address as `my_list`. This means that both `my_list` and `my_other_list` now refer to the same list object in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since lists are mutable in Python, we can modify the list object in place using either name. For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_list.append(4)\n",
    "print(my_other_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this code, we are using the `append()` method to add a new element to the list object referred to by `my_list`. Since `my_other_list` refers to the same list object, this modification is also visible when we print `my_other_list`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This behavior is what leads to mutability issues in Python. Since multiple names can refer to the same mutable object in memory, modifications to that object can have unexpected effects on other parts of your code that are using the same object.\n",
    "\n",
